### Problem Statement
Providing a logger which must be SIMPLE-STABLE-POWERFUL for embedded devices to PC and mainframe with flexible configuration.

### Motivation
SimpleLog-Challenge is designed to provide:
- Simplicity.
- Multi-thread and multi-process safe logging.
- Portability across Windows, Linux, macOS, ...
- Compatibility from ANSI C89 to C++20.
- Zero external dependencies.
- Extremely high performance (1.1M+ msg/sec) even up to 3M+ msg.sec (may reach limitation of SSD [450MB/500MB](https://github.com/thuanalg/simplelog-challenge/blob/main/src/linux/fork_test.txt) in a few cases) on PC-Linux.
- Stable up to billions of records.
- Message safety.
- Nano sec accuracy.

It is suitable on most of platforms I know, especially with high precision as openBMC.

  
### üß© Design Details


| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `spc_written_thread_routine` | **[Mandatory]** The main thread responsible for writing log data to the file or output stream. |
| `spc_trigger_routine` | **[Optional]** A secondary thread that can be enabled via configuration to trigger log flushing, [trigger=](https://github.com/thuanalg/simplelog-challenge/blob/main/src/simplelog-challenge.cfg). |
  
  
### üõ†Ô∏è Exported APIs

SimpleLog-Challenge provides 5 key APIs for initializing, logging, and process control:

| APIs | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `int spc_init_log_ext(SPC_INPUT_ARG *input);` | **[Mandatory]** Initialize the logger with extended input settings. |
| `int spc_finish_log();` | **[Mandatory]** Finalize and clean up the logger. |
| `spclog(log_level, fmt, ...);` | **[Mandatory]** Log a message with the specified level. |
| `spclogtopic(log_level, topic_index, fmt, ...);` | **[Optional]** Log by [topics=](https://github.com/thuanalg/simplelog-challenge/blob/main/src/simplelog-challenge.cfg) from 1 to n. |
| `LLU spc_update_processid();` | **[Optional]** Update process ID, typically used after `fork()` [example](https://github.com/thuanalg/simplelog-challenge/blob/main/tests/fork/main.c). |


### Alternatives Considered
- No. Give one more option.

### Impact
There is no intention to replace old libraries, because it needs time to verify, but is really worthy for trying new applications.

### Testing and Validation
- [Benchmarks on Windows, Linux, macOS vs spdlog](https://github.com/thuanalg/simplelog-challenge/blob/x1/README.md#benchmarking-performance)
- [1B record stress test Windows](https://github.com/thuanalg/simplelog-challenge/blob/main/performance/250113-1billion-multi-processes.txt)
- [1B record stress test Linux](https://github.com/thuanalg/simplelog-challenge/blob/main/performance/250217-CentOS-09-performance-8-Core-1Billion.txt)
- However, you can try with [Benchmarking Linux 8 cores](https://github.com/thuanalg/simplelog-challenge/blob/main/performance/250217-CentOS-09-performance-8-Core.txt) first ( find **How to run**). And do same with Windows/MAC OSX.

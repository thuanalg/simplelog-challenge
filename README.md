### ðŸŒŸ **Key Features**:  

1. **Multi-threaded Logging**  
   - Supports safe and efficient logging in multi-threaded environments without performance bottlenecks.  

2. **Multi-process Logging**  
   - Handles concurrent logging across multiple processes using robust synchronization techniques.  

3. **Wide Compatibility**  
   - Works seamlessly with both classic and modern C/C++ standards, from **ANSI C89** to **C++20**.  

4. **Cross-platform Support**  
   - Fully portable and tested on all major operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.).  

5. **Log Levels**  
   - Fine-grained control over log verbosity with multiple log levels.  

6. **Logging by Topic**  
   - Organize logs by specific topics for better traceability and debugging.  

7. **Real-time Logging**  
   - Ensures minimal latency for critical applications that require immediate log output.  

8. **File Rotation for Large Logs**  
   - Automatically rotates log files when they exceed a specified size, ensuring no data loss or performance degradation.  

9. **Small, Fast, and Simple**
	- It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, optimizing performance while ensuring simplicity in integration and use.

10. **No External Dependencies**
	- It requires no external dependencies, reducing complexity and making it easy to integrate into projects without compatibility issues.
